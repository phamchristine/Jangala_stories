                              <p>We are sisters, proudly french raised with a Vietnamese culture. We have the chance to have family spreaded all over the world and had the opportunity to travel ever since we were little. 
                                 <br><br>
                               Emilie and I always shared a common interest for travelling the cheapest way to discover as many places as possible. Together, with our backpack, we fell in love with the island of Siargao and we would like to share our story with you. But first, let's introduce ourselves.
                                 
                              </p>

                              <p>I am Emilie. I currently live in London and graduated from a Bachelor and science degree in Mathematics from Kings College. 
                              	I like to describe myself as an enthusiastic person with strong analytical and problem solving skills. 

                                 <br><br>
                                 In my spare time, I like to cook and bake for my friends. I have both French and Vietnamese influences in the dishes I make, which I find amazing.
                                 I love trying out new food and spices, you can probably tell food is a big part of my life!
                                
                              </p>

                              <p>I am Christine, the eldest sister of the three. I currently live in Paris and graduated from a Bachelor's degree in international management in Tourism. 
                                 <br><br>
                                 Thanks to job opportunities, I had the chance to live and travel abroad and discover different cultures. Amongst my memorable and favorite countries: Greece and Australia.

                              </p>

                              	Surfing became a thing for me in 2018 in Siargao, <i>the capital of surfing in the Philippines</i>, when Emilie and I first got onto a board and paddled out with locals. Never stopped ever since.
